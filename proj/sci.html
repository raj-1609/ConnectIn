    Science offers many career options such as engineering, medical and research roles. It is the most favourite career option for parents and students.
    The major advantage of science is, after class 12th you can switch from science to commerce or science to arts. There are multiple career options available for the science stream after class 12th.
    Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Biology are the main subjects in the Science stream.But there are many students who don't like Maths or don't have an interest in it, but if you want to pursue a career in medicine you can skip Maths and opt for other subjects.
